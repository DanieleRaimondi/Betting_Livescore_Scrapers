# Betting Exchange and Livescore Scrapers

This is a project I realized with four colleagues of mine during my Master.
I wanted to investigate how the odds of a live football match vary during the game, in relation with the what happens during it.
To answer it, we scraped odds from a popular betting exchange provider and comments and statistics from a livescore website.

Data Analyses follow to understand it.
